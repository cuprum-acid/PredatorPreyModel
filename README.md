# Predator-Prey Model
C++ program that implements predator-prey model:

Let's simulate that 200 white hares and 50 red foxes were brought to a desert island:

The fertility rate of hares is α<sub>1</sub> = 0.35

The hare mortality rate is β<sub>1</sub> = 0.01

α<sub>2</sub> = 0.5

β<sub>2</sub> = 0.002 Correspondingly.

We will observe them for 100 days at half-day intervals.

So the input to the program will be:
```
200
50
0.35
0.01
0.5
0.002
100
200
```
